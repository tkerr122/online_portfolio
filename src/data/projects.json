    "description": "I created a workflow extracting Canopy Height Models from lidar data to use as training for a CNN model. First step of the workflow is to use bash to batch download the lidar data. This script can be found in the \"tkerr122/bash\" repository. The next step is using the LidR and Parallel libraries in R to process the raw lidar data into Canopy Height models. This code can be found in the \"tkerr122/lidar_processing\" repository. Finally, the CHMs must be mosaiced into a single raster (script found in 'bash' repository), and cleaned of common errors such as powerlines, water, and slope errors. These scripts can be found in the \"CHM_cleaning\" repository.",
